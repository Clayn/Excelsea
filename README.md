# Excelsea

[![Build Status](http://www.clayncraft.de:8080/buildStatus/icon?job=Excelsea%2Fmain)](http://www.clayncraft.de:8080/job/Excelsea/job/main/)


This project is a collection of different modules that handle several aspects 
to develop an application.

You can either use the modules you require or use the entire Excelsea framework 
that contains all modules at once and provides you with an easy application setup.

The framework project (excelsea-fw) allows you to either create a basic application free for you to use, 
or an JavaFX application where you must provide the application class, and the framework will take care of initializing 
the JavaFX runtime and starting your application.
